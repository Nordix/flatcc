/*
 * Example of how to hash non-trivial data.
 *
 * It has a practical use with a parser the fills token structs as the
 * lexer digests them. The token string pointer can point directly into
 * the source buffer. If the token is a symbol, the parser can then
 * insert a pointer to token struct into the token map and later add type
 * and related information.
 *
 * Note that the hash table itself only stores a pointer so it is
 * reasonable to have a low load factor. The hashed string is never
 * allocated.

/*
 * Stores a pointer to a strbuf that contains the start and length of
 * a memory buffer, such a parsed string symbol. Similar to token_set
 * except a strbuf can be used to dynamically allocate memory. Once
 * hashed, a strbuf should be considered a constant. There is no benefit
 * in using a strbuf over a token for hash indexing purposes, but the
 * stored data might prefer the strbuf form, for example because the
 * memory content may have to be modified before being index, for
 * example by unescaping text within a larger block of text.
 *
 * The strbuf typically reside in some other structure that can be
 * obtained via container_of or similar pointer manipulation.
 *
 * The key data type is a token a direct memory reference because
 * a token is easily constructed from other buffer types.

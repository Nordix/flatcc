 * Stores a pointer to a table_t struct that holds its own allocated but
 * non-mutating memory and uses the table content as key. The table
 * control struct is typically placed in another struct that can be
 * found using container_of, but that is outside the scope of the hash
 * index. Mutating any table would invalidate the hash table index but
 * the hash table can then still be used to iterate over the content or
 * to destroy it.
 *
 * Tables with different element sizes can be mixed and will be considered
 * different even if the content is the same (e.g. all zero).
